# CS330-Portfolio
How do I approach designing software?
- The approach I took when building this program using OpenGL was different than my usual thought process because OpenGL is a complicated framework and it took a lot of practice to manage the syntax properly. While I strived to utilize object oriented programming principles for this software, I experienced some complications in doing so while dealing with the quirks of OpenGL, and opted to use a more procedural approach to compensate for this. 

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
- Using OpenGL has helped become a better critical thinker when building functions and encapsulating certain functionalities. This was very necessary when working with OpenGL and deciding on strategies needed to construct certain shapes; many of which required their own unique vertex arrangements and algorithms using the lin.math utility library to render correctly in the scene. 

What design process did you follow for your project work?
Many of the assignments throughout the class directly correlated to the end result of my project. Each week's milestone involved a different aspect of creating an OpenGL 3D scene. From the matrices, vertices, indices, colors, textures, lighting, and implementing movement via user key inputs. 

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
