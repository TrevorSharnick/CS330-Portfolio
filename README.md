How do I approach designing software?
- Typically, I try to create a design document specifying the functional and nonfunctional requirements of the software. Most of these specifications are outlined in

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
- Using OpenGL has helped become a better critical thinker when building functions and encapsulating certain functionalities. This was very necessary when working with OpenGL and deciding on strategies needed to construct certain shapes; many of which required their own unique vertex arrangements and algorithms using the lin.math utility library to render correctly in the scene. 

What design process did you follow for your project work?
Many of the assignments throughout the class directly correlated to the end result of my project. Each week's milestone involved a different aspect of creating an OpenGL 3D scene. From the matrices, vertices, indices, colors, textures, lighting, and implementing movement via user key inputs. 

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
- While I dont expect to use OpenGL in my future work, It has been very beneficial to hone my logical problem solving skills to complete the requirements of this project and I believe I will continue to practice these skills in future projects. 

How do I approach developing programs?
- The approach I took when building this program using OpenGL was different than my usual thought process because OpenGL is a complicated framework and it took a lot of practice to manage the syntax properly. While I strived to utilize object oriented programming principles for this software, I experienced some complications in doing so while dealing with the quirks of OpenGL, and opted to use a more procedural approach to compensate for this. 

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
- I had to do a great deal of tinkering with the the program, researching how to build complex shapes like the torus which required nested for loops and several mathematical formulas. The candle shape in the center of my scene is made up of both a torus, and a cylinder that is positioned inside it. 

How did iteration factor into your development?
- Each milestone helped me to incrementally develop this project into its final outcome; starting from basic vertices, and ending with a fully textured scene which uses the phong lighting model. 

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
- With each new milestone, I found that I needed to make adjustments to existing OpenGL code within my program. This wasnt the product of poorly encapsulated code however, since OpenGL already has built in functionality for working with textures and lighting, but in earlier modules they had not been utilized yet. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
- Computer science can help me develop code that is efficient, clear to read (by both myself and other developers), and adheres to best practices.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
- While I don't plan to use graphics and visualizations on my career path, I am certain that the skills I've learned in this course will be very beneficial when having or organize large amounts of code within a complex codebase. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
- Professionally, I believe the knowledge and skills I've obtained through this class, as well as this project itself, will be beneficial as a reference on my resume for potential employers because it demonstrates a working knowledge of challenging problem solving applications.
